**Docker Repository Overview**
Welcome to the repository for managing Docker-related assets! This repository serves as a centralized location for storing Docker-related files and workflows, enabling streamlined development, building, and deployment processes for our projects.

**Contents**
•	Dockerfile: The Dockerfile contains instructions for building the Docker image of our application. It specifies the environment, dependencies, and commands needed to create a runnable instance of our application within a Docker container.
•	Source Code: We include relevant source code files required for building the Docker image, ensuring that all necessary components are available for the Docker build process.
•	GitHub Workflows: This repository also houses GitHub workflows responsible for automating the Docker image build and push process. These workflows leverage the Dockerfile and other associated files to build the Docker image and push it to Docker Hub or another container registry.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of this repository is to centralize our Docker-related assets, providing a cohesive environment for managing Docker images, Dockerfiles, and associated workflows. By consolidating these resources, we aim to streamline our development workflow, enhance collaboration, and ensure consistency in our Docker-based deployments.

**Key Features**
•	Simplified Docker Image Management: With all Docker-related assets stored in one repository, managing Docker images becomes more straightforward and efficient.
•	Automated Build Process: GitHub workflows automate the build process, ensuring that Docker images are built consistently and pushed to the container registry without manual intervention.
•	Version Control: Dockerfiles and associated files are version-controlled, allowing us to track changes, revert to previous states, and collaborate effectively with team members.

**Usage**
To utilize the resources in this repository, follow these steps:
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Modify the Dockerfile and associated source code files as needed for your project.
3.	Configure the GitHub workflows according to your deployment requirements.
4.	Commit your changes and push them to the repository.
5.	GitHub workflows will automatically trigger builds and push Docker images to the specified container registry.
